## Advent of code 2023

Solving problems for fun. Trying to use different languages for each solution.

### Current solutions

- Day one: Rust using cargo
- Day two: TypeScript/JavaScript with node.js setting
- Day three: Go (first time using the language)
- Day four: Go
- Day five: C# (Got to use decorator pattern here, works great for part 1, but second part is still brute forced. I would have to use a more sophisticated data structure here; Range set, so an inter val tree might work, but requires a bit of studying first)
